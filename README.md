# My Go Projects

This repository contains all of my **Golang projects**, following the [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) CS path and my personal learning journey. Projects range from **basic exercises** to **intermediate CLI and RESTful API applications**.

Each project demonstrates my understanding of Go, including:

- Core Go concepts (variables, loops, functions, structs)
- File handling and JSON persistence
- CLI application development
- Web APIs and RESTful design
- Error handling, testing, and project organization
